                        <p>&emsp;Rachel is the president and co-founder of SBI. She is a junior majoring in biomedical engineering,
                            with the hopes of pursuing an MD-PhD upon graduation. She was first exposed to synthetic biology
                            as a member of the 2016 iGEM team, when she worked with seven other students to engineer a synthetic
                            mosquito repellent that provides continuous protection. Through this experience, she realized
                            that the Columbia community could benefit from an organization that spreads awareness about the
                            positive applications of synthetic biology, and so SBI was born. Beyond her involvement with
                            SBI, Rachel conducts research in Professor Kam Leong’s Stem Cell and Nanotherapeutics lab at
                            CUMC. On campus, she is the Fundraising Lead of Columbia Against Cancer, an associate editor
                            for the Columbia Journal of Global Health, and a Stressbuster Captain. Passionate about giving
                            back to the community at large, she volunteers at Mt. Sinai St. Luke’s Hospital and works with
                            the non-profit organization Chemocomfort, making care packages for patients undergoing chemotherapy.
                            In her free time, she enjoys listening to music, going on walks, and watching sitcoms.

                                    cell gene expressions. At the Tufts University Silk Lab he helped test various methods
                                    for developing less expensive more efficient methods for the process of turning silkworm
                                    cocoons into pure silk protein fibers to be used in implantable medical materials and

                                <p>&emsp;IHello! My name is Lauren Sekiguchi, and I attend Columbia University's School of Engineering
                                    and Applied Science. I'm planning to major in Biomedical Engineering, and aspire to become
                                    a physician-scientist. I grew up in Westchester, NY, but consider Tokyo, Japan, to be
                                    my home. In my free time, I love to be around kids and enjoy making humerus puns!
